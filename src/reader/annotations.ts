/* Live rendering of `$…$` in the reader's annotation comments.
 *
 * The constraint that shapes all of this: on every input the reader runs its
 * own `clean()` over the live comment element and then reads the comment back
 * out of it. Anything of ours still in the DOM at that moment would be saved
 * into the annotation. So the rendering comes out synchronously on `input` in
 * the capture phase — React attaches its handler at the root container, so ours
 * runs first — and goes straight back in on the way out, in the bubble phase of
 * the same event. Both happen in one task, before the browser paints, so
 * nothing flickers; and rendered equations are cached by source, so putting
 * them back costs a clone rather than a trip through KaTeX.
 *
 * While a comment is focused, the equation the caret is inside stays as source,
 * so it can be edited; the rest of the comment renders around it. A rendered
 * equation is `contenteditable=false`, so the caret cannot be placed inside one
 * — clicking it has to put the source back and drop the caret in, or an
 * equation would become uneditable the moment it rendered.
