/* Expanding a snippet and walking its tabstops.

 * Latex Suite queues change specs into a CodeMirror state field and flushes them

 *
 * Tabstop positions are kept in whatever coordinates the buffer's backend uses
 * and remapped through every later edit to it, so typing into a placeholder
 * grows its range the way CodeMirror's mark decorations did.
