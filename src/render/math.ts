/* Rendering `$…$` in annotation comments.
 *
 * KaTeX in `output: "mathml"` mode: Gecko renders MathML natively, so this
 * needs no stylesheet and no fonts. Notes need none of it — Zotero renders
 * their equation nodes itself.
 *
 * Rendering is reversible, and has to be. On every keystroke the reader runs
 * its own `clean()` over the live element and then reads the comment back out
 * of it, so anything of ours still in the DOM at that moment would end up in
 * the saved comment. The original `$…$` is therefore kept on the element that
 * replaced it, and put back before the reader ever looks.
